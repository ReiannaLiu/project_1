# Stock Market Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze various aspects of the stock market using datasets from Yahoo Finance and Geoapify data. The analysis is broken down into several research questions, each tackled by different team members:

## Research Questions

### 1. Concentration of Stock Market Companies by Region/State

#### Researcher: Reianna Liu
The goal is to identify which region or state has the highest concentration of stock market companies. Geospatial data and information will be utilized to create a map visualization showing the distribution of stock market companies across different regions.


### 2. Growth of Stock Prices for Companies over Time
#### Researcher: Ziye Jin

This analysis focuses on understanding the growth of stock prices for different companies over a specified time period. A line chart visualization will be created to display both the companies with the highest growth in stock prices and companies with most decline during the given period.

### 3. Spread of Managers' Age in Stock Market Companies
#### Researcher: Ziye Jin

This research question involves examining the spread of managers' ages within stock market companies. A box plot will be generated to visualize the distribution of managers' ages, providing insights into the age demographics of managerial positions.

### 4. Publisher Distribution for Recent News by Company
